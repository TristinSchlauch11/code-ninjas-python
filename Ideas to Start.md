Creating a 6-hour Intro to Python course (appx. 3 hrs teaching, 2 hrs exercises, 1 hr "free" time)

*I should create a cheat sheet that the kids can reference if needed*

Some projects could include:
- Mad Libs (for exercise after Inputs)
- Rock-Paper-Scissors(-Lizard-Spock) (for exercise after Lists)
- Hangman (final project) -- DONE
- Advanced Calculator (final project 2)
- Number Guesser (final project 3)

# Things to teach:

### Basics
- print function
- strings: concatenation, quotes in strings
- integers: math operations (+, -, *, /), min, max, can print numbers

### Variables
- what they are and how to use them
- assignment using "="
- can use variables to calculate other variables

### Input
- the input() function: can use it to get info from user to customize program behaviour
- store input in variables
- type conversions
- use the variable in the scripts

### Booleans
- Basics: True, False, what they mean
- conditionals for math (<, >, ==, !=, >=, <=)
- connectors (AND, OR, NOT)
- if, elif, else statements

### Lists
- what they are and how they are used
- common list functions (append, pop, len, indexing)
- the "in" function --> creates a Boolean

### For Loops
- syntax
- range function -- different formats (1 vs 2 vs 3 params)
- usage of lists and the "in" format

### While Loops
- syntax

### Functions
- syntax, parameters
- return
- how to call them somewhere else

## Other Possible Ideas
- Python Part 2: 
    - Modulo, String methods
    - Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
    - Classes
    - random and math module
- Make the graphical Python programming module
